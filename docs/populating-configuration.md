# Populating Configuration
The document describes how to prepare Fleet Manager to be able to start by
populating its configurations.

Follow all subsections to get a bootable Fleet Manager server.

## Interacting with the Fleet Manager API

The Fleet Manager API requires OIDC Bearer tokens, which use the JWT format,
for authentication. The token is passed as an `Authorization` HTTP header value.

To be able to perform requests to the Fleet Manager API, you first need
to get a JWT token from the configured OIDC authentication server, which is
Red Hat SSO (sso.redhat.com) by default. Assuming the default OIDC authentication server is
being used, this can be performed by interacting with the OCM API. This can be
easily done interacting with it through the [ocm cli](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases)
and retrieve OCM tokens using it. To do so:
1. Login to your desired OCM environment via web console using your Red Hat
   account credentials. For example, for the OCM production environment, go to
   https://cloud.redhat.com and login.
1. Get your OCM offline token by going to https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token
1. Login to your desired OCM environment through the OCM CLI by providing the
   OCM offline token and environment information:
   ```
   ocm login --token <ocm-offline-token> --url <ocm-api-url>
   ```
   `<ocm-api-url>` is the URL of the OCM API. Some shorthands can also
   be provided like `production` or `staging`
1. Generate an OCM token by running: `ocm token`. The generated token is the token
   that should be used to perform a request to the Fleet Manager API. For example:
  ```
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <result-of-ocm-token-command>" http://127.0.0.1:/8000/api/dinosaurs_mgmt
  ```
  OCM tokens other than the OCM offline token have an expiration time so a
  new one will need to be generated when that happens

There are some additional steps needed if you want to be able to perform
certain actions that have additional requirements. See the
[_User Account & Organization Setup_](getting-credentials-and-accounts.md#user-account--organization-setup) for more information

## Setting up OCM tokens

The Fleet Manager itself requires the use of an OCM token so it can
interact with OCM to perform management of Data Plane clusters.

In order for the Fleet Manager to do so, an OCM offline token should be configured.
To do so, retrieve your OCM offline token and then configure it for Fleet
Manager by running:
```
make ocm/setup OCM_OFFLINE_TOKEN=<your-retrieved-ocm-offline-token>
```

## Allowing creation of *Standard* Dinosaur instances

Fleet Manager is able to create two types of Dinosaur instances:
* Eval instances
  * Instances of this type are automatically deleted after 48 hours by default
    > NOTE: This can be controlled by setting the `--dinosaur-lifespan` Fleet
            Manager binary CLI flag
  * All authenticated users that make use of the Fleet Manager can
    request the creation of a Dinosaur eval instance
  * There is a limit of one instance per user
* Standard instances
  * Instances of this type are not automatically deleted
  * In order to be able to create an instance of this type, the user that
    is creating it must have enough quota

If you are not interested in making use of Standard Dinosaur instances you
can skip this section. Otherwise, keep reading below.

As commented above, In order o be able to create an instance of this type, the
user must have enough quota to do it. There are currently two ways to define
quotas for users in Fleet Manager:
* Through a Quota Management List configuration file. This is the default
  method used. Follow the the [Quota Management List Configurations](quota-management-list-configuration.md)
  guide for more detail on how to configure it
* By leveraging Red Hat's Account Management Service (AMS). For more information
  about this method, look at the [Quota Management with Account Management Service (AMS) SKU](getting-credentials-and-accounts.md#quota-management-with-account-management-service-ams-sku)

To select the type of quota to be used by Fleet Manager set the `--quota-type`
which accepts either `ams` or `quota-management-list`Fleet Manager binary CLI
flag.

## Setup AWS configuration
Fleet Manager interacts with AWS to provide the following functionalities:
* To be able to create and manage Data Plane clusters in a specific AWS account
  by passing the needed credentials to OpenShift Cluster Management
* To create [AWS's Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) DNS records in a
  specific AWS account. This records are DNS records that point to some
  routes related to Dinosaurs instances that are created.
  > NOTE: The domain name used for this records can be configured by setting
    the domain name to be used for Dinosaur instances. This cane be done
    through the `--dinosaur-domain-name` Fleet Manager binary CLI flag
For both functionalities, the same underlying AWS account is used.

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following files:
```
touch secrets/aws.accountid
touch secrets/aws.accesskey
touch secrets/aws.secretaccesskey
touch secrets/aws.route53accesskey
touch secrets/aws.route53secretaccesskey
```

If you need any of those functionalities keep reading. Otherwise, this section
can be skipped.

To accomplish the previously mentioned functionalities Fleet Manager needs to
be configured to interact with the AWS account. To do so, provide existing AWS
IAM user credentials to the control plane by running:
```
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<aws-account-id> \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-iam-user-access-key> \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-iam-user-secret-access-key> \
ROUTE53_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-iam-user-for-route-53-access-key> \
ROUTE53_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-iam-user-for-route-53-secret-access-key> \
make aws/setup
```
> NOTE: If you are in Red Hat, the following [documentation](./getting-credentials-and-accounts.md#aws)
  might be useful to get the IAM user/s credentials

## Setup additional SSO configuration
A different SSO server other than the default authentication server (Red Hat SSO)
is needed in Fleet Manager to enable some functionalities:
* To enable communication between the Fleetshard operator (in the data plane) and the Fleet Manager
* To configure the OpenShift cluster identity provider in Data Plane clusters
  to give SRE access to them

This additional SSO server must be based on Keycloak.

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following files:
```
touch secrets/keycloak-service.clientId
touch secrets/keycloak-service.clientSecret
touch secrets/osd-idp-keycloak-service.clientId
touch secrets/osd-idp-keycloak-service.clientSecret
```

If you need any of those functionalities keep reading. Otherwise, this section
can be skipped.

Two alternatives are offered here to use as the SSO Keycloak server:
* Use MAS-SSO
  >NOTE: MAS-SSO is soon going to be deprecated. Reach out to the MAS-Security team for info regarding this.
* Run your own Keycloak server instance by following their [getting-started guide](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker). Please note, how to setup Keycloak is out of scope of this guide

To accomplish the previously mentioned functionalities Fleet Manager needs to
be configured to interact with this additional SSO server.

Create/Have available two client-id/client-secret pair of credentials (called Keycloak Clients)
in the SSO Keycloak server, one for each previously mentioned functionality, and
then set Fleet Manager to use them by running the following command:
```
 SSO_CLIENT_ID="<sso-client-id>" \
 SSO_CLIENT_SECRET="<sso-client-secret>" \
 OSD_IDP_SSO_CLIENT_ID="<osd-idp-sso-client-id>" \
 OSD_IDP_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET="<osd-idp-sso-client-secret" \
 make keycloak/setup
```

Additionally, make sure you start the Fleet Manager server with the appropriate
Keycloak SSO Realms and URL for this. See the
[Fleet Manager CLI feature flags](./feature-flags.md#keycloak) for details on it.

## Setup the data plane image pull secret
In the Data Plane cluster, the Dinosaur Operator and the FleetShard Deployments
might reference container images that are located in authenticated container
image registries.

Fleet Manager can be configured to send this authenticated
container image registry information as a K8s Secret in [`kubernetes.io/.dockerconfigjson` format](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials).

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following file:
```
touch secrets/image-pull.dockerconfigjson
```

If you don't need to make use of this functionality you can skip this section.
Otherwise, keep reading below.

To configure the Fleet Manager with this authenticated registry information so
the previously mentioned Data Plane elements can pull container images from it:
* Base-64 encode your [Docker configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#docker-cli-configuration-file-configjson-properties).
* Copy the contents generated from the previous point into the `secrets/image-pull.dockerconfigjson` file

## Setup the Observability stack secrets
Fleet Manager provides the ability to provide and configure monitoring metrics
related to the Data Planes and its Dinosaur instances. To do so it makes
use of what's called the ([Observability Stack](./observability/README.md#observability-stack)

To configure and make use of the Observability stack to offer monitoring metrics
related to the Data Planes and its Dinosaur instances Fleet Manager needs to:
* Access the Observability Stack's Observatorium service to retrieve and then
  offer the metrics as one of the Fleet Manager API endpoints
* To send the credentials/information needed to setup the Observability Stack
  when it is installed in the Data Plane clusters

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following files:
```
	touch secrets/rhsso-logs.clientId
	touch secrets/rhsso-logs.clientSecret
	touch secrets/rhsso-metrics.clientId
	touch secrets/rhsso-metrics.clientSecret
	touch secrets/observability-config-access.token
```

If you are not interested in making use of this functionality you can skip
this section. Otherwise, keep reading below.

The following command is used to setup the various secrets needed by
the Observability stack:
```
OBSERVATORIUM_CONFIG_ACCESS_TOKEN="<observatorium-config-access-token> \
RHSSO_LOGS_CLIENT_ID=<rhsso-logs-client-id> \
RHSSO_LOGS_CLIENT_SECRET=<rhsso-logs-client-secret> \
RHSSO_METRICS_CLIENT_ID=<rhsso-metrics-client-id> \
RHSSO_METRICS_CLIENT_SECRET=<rhsso-metrics-client-secret> \
make observatorium/setup
```

The description of the previously shown parameters are:
* OBSERVATORIUM_CONFIG_ACCESS_TOKEN: A GitHub token required to fetch the configuration from a private git repository. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/observability-operator#adding-requisite-resources). 
* RHSSO_LOGS_CLIENT_ID, RHSSO_LOGS_CLIENT_SECRET: An OAuth's client-id/client-secret credentials pair to push logs to Observatorium. Used to authenticate via `sso.redhat.com` when logging via `config.promtail.enabled` is set in the observability configuration. Provided by the Observatorium team.
* RHSSO_METRICS_CLIENT_ID, RHSSO_METRICS_CLIENT_SECRET: An OAuth's client-id/client-secret credentials pair to push metrics to Observatorium. Used to authenticate via `sso.redhat.com` when `config.prometheus.observatorium` is set in the observability configuration. Provided by the Observatorium team.

See [Observability](./observability/README.md) to learn more about
Observatorium and the Observability Stack.

## Setup a custom TLS certificate for Dinosaur Host URLs

When Fleet Manager creates Dinosaur instances, it can be configured to
send a custom TLS certificate to associate to each one of the Dinosaur instances
host URLs. That custom TLS certificate is sent to the data plane clusters where
those instances are located.

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following files:
```
touch secrets/dinosaur-tls.crt
touch secrets/dinosaur-tls.key
```

If you need to setup a custom TLS certificate for the Dinosaur instances' host
URLs keep reading. Otherwise, this section can be skipped.

To configure Fleet Manager so it sends the custom TLS certificate, provide the
certificate and its corresponding key to the Fleet Manager by running the
following command:
```
DINOSAUR_TLS_CERT=<dinosaur-tls-cert> \
DINOSAUR_TLS_KEY=<dinosaur-tls-key> \
make dinosaurcert/setup
```
> NOTE: The certificate domain/s should match the URL endpoint domain if you
  want the certificate to be valid when accessing the endpoint
> NOTE: The expected Certificate and Key values are in PEM format, preserving
  the newlines

Additionally, make sure that the functionality is enabled by setting the
`--enable-dinosaur-external-certificate` Fleet Manager binary CLI flag

## Configure Sentry logging
Fleet Manager can be configured to send its logs to the
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) logging service.

In order for the Fleet Manager to be able to start, create the following files:
```
touch secrets/sentry.key
```

If you want to use Sentry set the Sentry Secret key in the `secrets/sentry.key`
previously created.

Additionally, make sure to set the Sentry URL endpoint and Sentry project when
starting the Fleet Manager server. See [Sentry-related CLI flags in Fleet Manager](./feature-flags.md#sentry)
